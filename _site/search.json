    "text": "Did you know past a HS diploma an income of 50k or greater would be determined by other factors than education level? This dataset pulled from kaggle, unveiling a fascinating snapshot of adult demographics, looks at 32,560 individuals from various walks of life. With ages ranging from 17 to 90, it captures a rich diversity of educational backgrounds, occupations, and marital statuses. Interestingly, the average workweek clocks in at about 40 hours, with occupations spanning from executive managerial roles to handlers and cleaners. While a significant portion of the dataset comprises U.S. citizens, there are also individuals from countries like Cuba, reflecting the multicultural tapestry of the workforce. Notably, the income distribution shows a stark division, shedding light on the socioeconomic factors at play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation between degree earned compared to income earned might surprise you. The following data was pulled from kaggle, a dataset of demographic and employment information from age, race, and gender, to hours worked per week to also degree earned. Each level of education has up to 4 bars: 2 per gender, and 2 for over 50k earned or 50k and less earned. The relevant data used was degree earned, salary earned, and gender. For example HS-grad has 4 occurences of both male, female, &gt;50k, and &lt;=50k. The X axis being the level of education and the y axis being the number of occurences. The legend shows the bar plots of which color meant which occurence of salary, and also the gender of the occurences of said income. Other factors like relationship status, and working industry are important, but earning at minimal a college degree seems enough to make atleast 50k income."
